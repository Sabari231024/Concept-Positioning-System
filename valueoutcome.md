**Concept Positioning System** â€” Developed a **scalable recommender system** suggesting concepts in a linear learning path by increasing difficulty. Leveraged Bayesian Personalized Ranking with 50.1% benchmark accuracy on Stack Overflow data. Implemented **distributed data-parallel pipelines** to efficiently process large-scale datasets. Explored advanced approaches including Bilateral VAEs, Collaborative Denoising Autoencoders, and CGAN-based synthetic data generation to enhance recommendation quality and student engagement.

171,insertion-sort,"Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm with worst-case time complexity of O(n²) and best-case time-complexity of Θ(n). It builds the final array by moving elements upward into the sorted position, one at a time."
172,divide-and-conquer,Divide-and-conquer is a top-down technique for designing algorithms that consists of dividing the problem into smaller subproblems hoping that the solutions of the subproblems are easier to find and then composing the partial solutions into the solution of the original problem.
173,asymptotic-complexity,Asymptotic complexity is an approximation of the edge case performance of an algorithm used to determine best and worst case scenarios.
174,minimum-spanning-tree,"A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph with the least possible weight."
175,heapsort,Heapsort is an efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides an input into a sorted and an unsorted part and iteratively shrinks the unsorted part by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted part. Run time is O(n log n).
176,dynamic-arrays,"Anything related to dynamic arrays, i.e. array-like data structures where the length of the array (the number of its elements) can be changed at runtime, thus allowing adding or removing elements without explicit memory allocation and management."
177,spanning-tree,"A spanning tree in an connected, undirected graph is a subgraph that includes all vertices, is a tree and is connected."
178,depth-first-search,"Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching a tree, tree structure, or graph. One starts at the root (selecting some node as the root in the graph case) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking."
179,stable-sort,The sorting algorithm is stable if the initial order of equal values is preserved after sorting.
180,matrix-multiplication,"Questions related to matrix multiplication, especially implementation. Mathematical questions should consider the [linear-algebra] tag."
181,data-structures,A data structure is a way of organizing data in a fashion that allows particular properties of that data to be queried and/or updated efficiently.
182,tree-balancing,"In the context of data structures, tree balancing refers to reorganizing the nodes in a binary search tree to ensure that the height of the tree is not too large."
183,array-multisort,PHP's array_multisort — sorts multiple or multi-dimensional arrays
184,set-cover,"In combinatorics, it is the problem of selecting a minimum number of sets so that these sets combined
contain all the elements found in some reference set."
185,singly-linked-list,"A linked list in which each node only points to the next node in the list, as opposed to a doubly-linked list in which each node points to both the next and the previous nodes. This tag should be used with additional tags indicating the programming language being used ([c], [c++], [java], etc.) and any libraries or plug-ins being used such as [c++-standard-library]. The post itself should contain source code for the issue."
186,longest-substring,"Longest Substring is a classic computer science problem: given two strings, find the common strings, then return the string(s) in common with the greatest length."
187,greatest-common-divisor,"The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more non-zero integers, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder."
188,automata-theory,"Automata theory studies classes of algorithms which can be defined using abstract machines (automata). Classes of automata differ in terms of restrictions to which they are subjected; for the most common classes, the primary difference concerns memory and how transitions between states may access it. More powerful classes can define more powerful algorithms; according to the Church-Turing thesis, no real machine is more powerful than Turing Machines."
189,array-algorithms,"Array Algorithms are defined as functional algorithms where each step of the algorithm results in a function being applied to an array, producing an array result"
190,simplex,A simplex is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimension.
191,variable-length-array,A variable length array (VLA) is an array in C99 and other languages whose size is non-constant.
192,partition-problem,"In computer science, the partition problem is to decide whether a given multiset of integers can be partitioned into two ""halves"" that have the same sum."
193,bellman-ford,"The Bellman–Ford algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in a weighted digraph. For graphs with only non-negative edge weights, the faster Dijkstra's algorithm also solves the problem. Thus, Bellman–Ford is used primarily for graphs with negative edge weights. The algorithm is named after its developers, Richard Bellman and Lester Ford, Jr."
194,rabin-karp,The Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm is a string matching algorithm that employs a rolling hash function to speed up the search.
195,ford-fulkerson,The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is an algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a flow network.  It only works on graphs with integer capacities and has poor performance on graphs with large flows.
196,tree-rotation,Tree rotation is an operation on a binary tree that changes the structure without interfering with the order of the elements.
197,edmonds-karp,The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a flow network.
198,minmax-heap,A minmax heap is a type of double-ended priority queue data structure based on a complete binary tree.
199,treepath,TreePath represents an array of objects that uniquely identify the path to a node in a tree. The elements of the array are ordered with the root as the first element of the array.
